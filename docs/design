requirements:

+ support haml, md
+ static page preview
+ static page indexing

design:

directory layout example:
   
+ src
+-- site.sqlite3
+-- article1.md
+-- article2.md
+-- layout.haml
+-- navbar.haml
+-- footer.haml

* create a flat hierarchy of html files
* js, css, images are found in folders
* reference architecture suggests that source files be stored in src folder

sitemap:

sqlite database for indexing pages

articles( id, creation, modification, title, layout, src )


1.  crawl src directory for files ending with .haml, .md (.mkd, .markdown)
2.  hash files, compare with site.sqlite3 file to find revisions
3.  create main page consisting of default latest 10
  a.  shrink content to less than x words
  b.  organize by latest at the top
4.  create individual pages

in the initial version, layout.haml, navbar.haml were fixed templates.  this
assumes that each site will have these files.  there can actually be multiple
layouts for a site so there needs to be a mapping of layouts to content (md
files).  also there should be enough flexibility to not have navbars, or
multiple navbars, etc.

there will be 4 main types of haml templates: page layouts, navbars, footers,
and contents.

layout files are the main templates that house the structure of the site,
from enclosing html tags to the head which includes all of the stylesheets
and javascript assets.  in order to identify layout files, the filename will
be searched for the substring "layout.haml".

e.g.

layout.haml
main.layout.haml
sub-layout.haml
layout-sub.haml (not valid)

each of these will be listed in the layouts table

navbars are embedded in layout templates and need to have the "navbar.haml"
identifier in the filename.

footers are also embedded in layout templates and need to have the
"footer.haml" identifier in the filename.

content templates are also embedded in layout templates and need to have the
"content.haml" identifier in the filename.

if there's only one set of navbars, footer, and layout, then the user
won't be prompted.

the above is for a more advanced version, let's keep things simple, you
must have layout.haml, index.haml, and page.haml.

1.  layout.haml defines the overall site from html tags to body and head.
meta requires this file be present in order to compile.

2.  index.haml includes the content for the main page of a site, typically
it's a summary of all posts.

3.  page.haml includes the content for a single post.

let's initially support the case where layout.haml, index.haml, and page.haml
are required.

custom templates:

assume a site has pages for about, projects, etc.  there should be a generic
way to associate a layout and content layer, and the process should be very
simple.

assume there are these types of posts:

1.  blog:  mostly original text from an author, can contain pictures, tables,
etc.
2.  picture:  picture only post, no text.  will include pictures from other
sources only, will not store many pictures on my site.
3.  recommended link: user submit's url, title, summary, maybe a picture
included.
